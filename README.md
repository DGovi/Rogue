##Objectives
Learn how to use different tools to develop software and implement Agile methods in our workflow. The goal is to deliver incremental working software throughout each end of the Sprints (Potentially Shippable Product Increment). We shall follow the Agile Manifesto:
* __Individuals and interactions__ over processes and tools
* __Working software__ over comprehensive documentation
* __Customer collaboration__ over contract negotiation
* __Responding to change__ over following a plan

##Description
Create an online application with features of a simplified version of Instagram. The platform will let users post photos on their accounts which will be viewable to other users that can themselves leave comments on the content. As well as viewing others users posts, a user will be able to "follow" them to add their content to a feed and receive a notification.

##Core Features
* Users can post a picture on their account
* A user can follow another user and get notifications and the content added to their feed
* A user can leave comments on posted pictures

##Languages used
>TBD
